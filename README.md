# Scalable Database Midterm Project

# Project Objective: Analyzing New York City Data with SQL, Python, and Version Control

##Project Goal
- The end goal is to uncover patterns and trends that can help law enforcement and policymakers make data-driven decisions and keep New York City residence safety and reduce the crime

## Datasets Use for this project 

1. NYPD Shooting Incident
2. NYPD Arrest
3. NYPD Hate Crime

## Steps taken to complete this project

1. Downloaded data from [Data.Gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/?organization=city-of-new-york)

## Installation
1. Git
2. Version Control
3. Visual Studio code
4. PySpark


## Libraries
1. Pandas
2. numpy
3. Seaborn
4. matplotlib

## Database
Sqlite3

## Business Questions

### NYPD HateCrime Dataset
1. Borough with highest hatecrime
2. Top Bias Motivation
3. Crime over time

### NYPD Arrest Dataset
1. Borough with the most arrests
2. Age with the highest arrest
3. Top Offense by Borough
4. Arrest over time

### NYPD Shooting Dataset
1. How crimes are varied in each year
2. Which Sex has been highly impacted?
3. Which race are mostly perpetrators 
4. How many incidents are recorded as Statistical murders

### Procedures
1. Import the necessary Libraries
2. Read in and view all three data sets
3. Clean and Transform Data set using Pandas and numpy libraries
4. Data Exploration using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries
5. Merge all three datasets on common columns
6. Perform SQL queries on merged dataset using Sqlite3

### Challenges
1. Inconsistent data formatt
2. Incorrect data type
3. Handling missing values
4. Misspelling

# Conclusion:

- The analyses of the NYPD hatecrime, shooting, and arrest datasets revealed several insights into crime patterns and demographics in New York City. Key findings show hate crimes disproportionately target Jewish, Asian, and LGBTQ+ communities, shootings predominantly involve young Black male, and Hispanic perpetrators, and arrests are concentrated in lower-income boroughs like Brooklyn and Bronx.

- Some trends are the decline in overall arrests and shootings from the mid-2000s peak, but with spikes in recent years. The data also shows a correlation between certain demographics and types of crimes. For example, hate crimes correlate with race, sexual orientation, and religion while shootings correlate with age, borough, and race of the perpetrators.

# Recommendations:
1. Increase community outreach and police presence in vulnerable neighborhoods to further reduce crime rates.

2. Focus youth engagement programs and job opportunities in high-risk areas to provide alternatives to gang involvement.

3. Improve bias training for police officers and continue de-escalation tactics to lower arrests.

4. Expand reporting and support services for marginalized groups to address the underreporting of hate crimes.

5. Conduct further analysis into precipitating circumstances of crimes to guide situational prevention efforts.

6. Develop crime early-warning systems using statistical models to deploy resources proactively based on data insights.

# Summary
Targeted strategies informed by data analysis can help reduce crime and improve community-police relations if implemented responsibly with community involvement. Sustained efforts are needed to promote safety and justice for all New Yorkers.
